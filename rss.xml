The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sleep Beneath the Stars in the Italian Alps | Travel Away</h1><p>A brainchild of local hotelier Raniero Campigotto, Starlight Room Dolomites is a mobile glass-encased bedroom tucked away in the picturesque Italian Alps, 20 km from the swanky ski resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Perched at an altitude of 2,055 meters, the secluded cabin rewards those who brave the climb up with marvelous mountain views by day and pollution-free starry skies by night.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0895eb60736ea7b14be4c5d3a67591db4746a3c6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
